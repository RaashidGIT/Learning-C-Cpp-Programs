Algorithm for Searching and Counting Occurrences in an Array:

1. Initialize variables: array[100], search, c, n, count = 0.

2. Prompt user:
   - Input number of elements `n`.
   - Input `n` numbers into `array`.

3. Prompt user:
   - Input number to search `search`.

4. Initialize `count` to 0.

5. Loop through each element of `array` from index 0 to `n-1`:
   a. If `array[c]` is equal to `search`:
      i. Print `search` is present at location `c + 1`.
      ii. Increment `count` by 1.

6. After loop:
   - If `count` is 0:
      - Print `search` isn't present in the array.
   - Else:
      - Print `search` is present `count` times in the array.

7. End program.
