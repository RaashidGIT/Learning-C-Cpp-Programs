## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [GCC Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Basic knowledge of C and C++ programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-cpp-programming-lab.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```sh
